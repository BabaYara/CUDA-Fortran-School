This is a standalone code that compute the spherical harmonic (SH)  functions
of  a vector g. The subroutine computing the  SH is from Quantum Espresso (with
external dependences on modules removed).

Compile the code for CPU and study the OpenMP scalability.

Optimize the CPU implementation ( hint: cost,sint,phi can be scalar quantities
if the loops are rearranged).

Write the code for GPU using CUDA Fortran.
