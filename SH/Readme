This is a standalone code that computes the spherical harmonic (SH)  functions
of  a vector g. The subroutine computing the  SH is from Quantum Espresso (with
external dependences on modules removed).

Compile the code for CPU and study the OpenMP scalability:
the run_me.sh will report the time with different number of threads

Optimize the CPU implementation: 
	hint: cost,sint,phi can be scalar quantities if the loops are rearranged

Write the code for GPU using CUDA Fortran.
