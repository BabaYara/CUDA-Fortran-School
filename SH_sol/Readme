This directory contains several implementations

ylmr2_new.f90: Code for CPU (openmp)  and GPU (CUF kernel).
	cost,sent,phi are scalar
	Q(ng, 0:lmax,0:lmax) is a 3D array

ylmr2_gpu.f90: GPU code (CUDA Fortran ).


The Makefile will build 3 differente executables:

ym_cpu_comparison: it will compare the original CPU code with the new one

ym_gpu_comparison: it will compare the original CPU code with the GPU one generated by the CUF kernel

ym_gpu2_comparison: it will compare the original CPU code with the hand coded  GPU kernel
